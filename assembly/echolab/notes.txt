I've divided the workflow into 2 .asm files. Inside Resources I have the functions that I may use in the future, the echo.asm is just the main file.
In order to compile the files, I've used nasm version 2.14.02, and in order to emulate the boot process, I've used Qemu version 4.2.0. This process can also
be done by using the "adriancovaci" script to generate an img file which can be used as a floppy drive.

To compile the files:
    nasm -f bin resources.asm -o resources.bin
    nasm -f bin echo.asm -o echo.bin

To emulate:
    qemu-system-x86_64 echo.bin
