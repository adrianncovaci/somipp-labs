hello.asm -> Assembly file to compile
adriancovaci -> Bash script which compiles the hello.asm file and generates an
.img file (You need to have GNU BASH installed in order to run it).

In order to run the script file, one can make it executable by running "chmod +x
adriancovaci" into the terminal. Then we can run the script by providing 2
arguments, the source .asm file, and the desired bootable floppy image file.

e.g "./adriancovaci hello.asm hello.img"

The NASM assembler should be installed in order to run the script. The script was successfully
tested on version:

NASM version 2.14.02

A .bin and a .img file will be generated. The .img file can be used, later on,
on virtual environment. Personally, I've used the 6.1.4 version of VirtualBox.
